In this project I created a simple ETL process that takes data from csv files, transform and clean that data 
and load that data into the wharehouse.
For this whole process I used phyton code in jupytor notebook and pandas to read data from csv files and transform
that data into the desired condition. Then the transformed data was loaded into PostgeSQL database.
